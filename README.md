# Melody-Web-App

This Melody Web App is a music web application that generates melodies using AI based on the musical ideas of the user. The input boxes allow the user to pick certain notes and play them, and then they can click the generate button to generate a melody of subsquent notes based on their input. I used Magenta, Vexflow, Tensorflow.js and Tone.js to build this - I used EasyScore from VexFlow to create a Staff and notes, Tone.js to play the notes, and Magenta to generate a melody based on the user's input.

This project was guided by Coursera's create a web app that generates melodies using Magenta's AI project course.
